# Backend Structure (Monolith — Hexagonal + CQRS)

## Overview

The monolith backend uses hexagonal architecture across all domains with a CQRS split:

- **REST** for commands (write operations)
- **GraphQL** for queries (read operations via a cross-domain read gateway)

All routes are versioned under `/api/v1/`. The `/health` and `/` endpoints remain at root.

**Note:** The user and transaction domains have been extracted into standalone microservices (`user-service` on port 8001, `transaction-service` on port 8002). The monolith retains local copies of user data via event-driven sync, but `user-service` is the source of truth for authentication. See the root `README.md` for the full microservices architecture.

## Runtime Entry Points

- `backend/main.py` — registers routers, middleware (CORS, request logging, correlation ID), and the GraphQL endpoint.
- `backend/dependencies.py` — wires application services with outbound adapters via FastAPI DI.
- `backend/shared/ports/` — cross-cutting port interfaces (`IAccountResolver`, `IUnitOfWork`).
- `backend/shared/adapters/` — cross-cutting adapter implementations (`MySQLAccountResolver`, `MySQLUnitOfWork`, auth DI wiring).
- `backend/tests/architecture/test_import_boundaries.py` — architecture fitness tests that enforce import boundaries at CI time.

## Active Bounded Contexts (still in monolith)

- `backend/transaction/` — CRUD, CSV import, planned transactions
- `backend/category/` — CRUD
- `backend/budget/` — legacy per-category budgets
- `backend/monthly_budget/` — aggregate-based monthly budgets with budget lines
- `backend/analytics/` — dashboard overview, GraphQL read gateway
- `backend/account/` — CRUD + account groups
- `backend/goal/` — CRUD
- `backend/user/` — registration/login (delegates to monolith MySQL, but user-service is source of truth)

Each context follows the same layout:

```text
<context>/
├── adapters/
│   ├── inbound/       # REST API (+ GraphQL for analytics)
│   └── outbound/      # Repository implementations
├── application/
│   ├── ports/         # Inbound + outbound interfaces
│   ├── service.py     # Application service
│   └── dto.py         # Data transfer objects
├── domain/
│   ├── entities.py
│   └── exceptions.py
└── __init__.py
```

## Event Consumers

The monolith includes two independent RabbitMQ consumers that react to `user.created` events from user-service:

| Consumer | Queue | Responsibility |
|----------|-------|---------------|
| `UserSyncConsumer` | `monolith.user_sync` | Sync user data to MySQL User table |
| `AccountCreationConsumer` | `monolith.account_creation` | Create default account in MySQL |

Both consumers:
- Listen on the same routing key (`user.created`) but use separate queues
- Inherit from `BaseConsumer` with retry (3 attempts), DLQ, and idempotency
- Run independently — failure in one does not affect the other
- Can be scaled independently via `--consumer` argument to `worker.py`

```bash
# Run specific consumer
python -m backend.consumers.worker --consumer user-sync
python -m backend.consumers.worker --consumer account-creation

# Run all consumers
python -m backend.consumers.worker
```

## Cross-Service Architecture Decisions

### No FK constraints to User table

The MySQL `Account.User_idUser` and `AccountGroups_has_User.User_idUser` columns have **no foreign key constraints** referencing the `User` table. This is intentional — in a microservices architecture, the MySQL User table is a local cache synced via events, not the source of truth. Cross-service referential integrity is maintained through eventual consistency, not database constraints.

The ORM relationships on `User.account_groups` and `AccountGroups.users` use explicit `primaryjoin`/`secondaryjoin`/`foreign_keys` parameters to work without FK metadata.

### JWT Cross-Service Compatibility

The monolith creates tokens with both `sub` (standard JWT claim) and legacy `user_id`/`username`/`email` fields. Token validation accepts either format, so tokens from both the monolith and user-service work across all services.

## Router Map

| Path | Domain | Protocol |
|------|--------|----------|
| `/api/v1/transactions/*` | Transaction | REST |
| `/api/v1/planned-transactions/*` | Transaction | REST |
| `/api/v1/categories/*` | Category | REST |
| `/api/v1/budgets/*` (CRUD) | Budget (legacy) | REST |
| `/api/v1/budgets/summary` | Analytics | REST |
| `/api/v1/monthly-budgets/*` (CRUD + copy) | Monthly Budget | REST |
| `/api/v1/monthly-budgets/summary` | Monthly Budget | REST |
| `/api/v1/dashboard/*` | Analytics | REST |
| `/api/v1/accounts/*` | Account | REST |
| `/api/v1/account-groups/*` | Account | REST |
| `/api/v1/goals/*` | Goal | REST |
| `/api/v1/users/*` | User | REST |
| `/api/v1/graphql` | Analytics (read gateway) | GraphQL |

## Middleware Stack

1. **CORS** — configured via `CORS_ORIGINS` env var.
2. **Request Logging** — logs method, path, status, duration_ms, and correlation_id.
3. **Correlation ID** — generates UUID per request (or forwards `X-Correlation-ID` header). Returned in `X-Correlation-ID` response header.

## Database Role Configuration

Settings in `backend/config.py`:

- `ACTIVE_DB` — global fallback
- `TRANSACTIONS_DB` — transaction domain
- `ANALYTICS_DB` — analytics domain (supports MySQL, Elasticsearch, Neo4j)
- `USER_DB` — user domain
